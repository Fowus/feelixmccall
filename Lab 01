## Part 3 - Command Line Navigation

My OS is:
- [x] Windows 
- [] Linux
- [] Mac

My Command Line Shell is: Windows Powershell

### Navigating My OS on the Command Line

1. Create a directory named `DirA`: mkdir DirA
2. Create a directory named `Dir B`: mkdir "Dir B"
3. Go into `DirA`: cd DirA
4. Go into `Dir B` from `DirA`: cd "../Dir B"
5. Return to your user's home directory: cd ..
6. Create a file named `test.txt`:  New-Item -Path . -Name "test.txt" -ItemType File
7. Move the file named `test.txt` into `DirA`: Move-Item -Path "test.txt" -Destination "DirA"
8. Contents of `test.txt`: Get-Content test.txt
```
I love coding, it makes me feel better.
```
9. Make a copy of `test.txt` named `copy.txt` in `DirA`:  Copy-Item "C:\Users\obons\DirA\test.txt" -Destination "C:\Users\obons\DirA\copy.txt"
10. View the contents of `DirA`: Get-ChildItem -Path "DirA"
11. Make a copy of `test.txt` in `Dir B` named `fodder.txt`: Copy-Item "C:\Users\obons\DirA\test.txt" -Destination "C:\Users\obons\Dir B\fodder.txt"
12. Delete / remove both `fodder.txt` AND `Dir B`: rmdir "Dir B"

YoTube; I was able to understand navigating my OS on the command line through videos on youtube. Also gave me a fair idea of how different commands perform the same function.
Google; It assisted me in the actions of what various commands does.
