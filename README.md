My name is Felix Owusu Agyemang, and I am currently a second-year student majoring in Information Technology and Cybersecurity. This semester, I will be focusing on a couple of key projects that align with my courses. One of the projects I’ll be working on is a PC Networking project, where I will explore and implement different networking concepts, troubleshooting techniques, and network security measures. Also, I will be involved in a project for my Database and Modeling course. In this project, I’ll be designing and developing a database system that models real-world scenarios. This will give me hands-on experience in creating efficient database schemas, normalizing data, and using SQL to query and manage information.
